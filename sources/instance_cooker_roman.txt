Width narrow master is set to 50, wide to 150 as it has been from the beginning. Must be kept at these values because of layer-switching being defined on these values.

Weight of the ‘regular’ masters is now set at 380. This makes the Regular instance set at 400 be a little darker, and allows users to specify 380 as a lighter alternative to the regular Regular.

Fill *all* the fields in the master custom parameter ‘Axis Location’.

Excuting this script will delete all existing instances *including* VF-instances!
