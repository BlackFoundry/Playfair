**Playfair 2.0** is stylistically a *trans­itional* design. From the time of enlight­en­ment in the late 18th cen­tury, the broad nib quills were replaced by poin­ted steel pens. This influ­enced typo­graph­ical let­ter­forms to become increas­ingly detached from the writ­ten ones. Devel­op­ments in print­ing tech­no­logy, ink, and paper mak­ing made it pos­sible to print let­ter­forms of high con­trast and del­ic­ate hairlines.

This design lends itself to this *trans­itional* period, and while it is not a revival of any par­tic­u­lar design, it takes influ­ence from the Caslon foundry type, the designs of printer and typeface designer John Bask­erville, the punch­cut­ter Wil­liam Martin’s typeface for the ‘Boy­dell Shak­speare’ (sic) edi­tion, and from the ‘Scotch Roman’ designs that fol­lowed thereafter.

**Playfair 2.0** is well suited for general purpose typesetting. It has an extra large x-height and short des­cend­ers. Because it is now a *variable font,* you the designer can seamlessly interpolate Playfair in three dimensions:
- *Widths* from Semi-Condensed to Semi-Expanded
- *Weights* from Normal to Black
- *Optical sizes* from Agate to Needlepoint

**Playfair 2.0** supports both the Latin and Cyrillic scripts with a glyph complement for the most used languages using these scripts.
